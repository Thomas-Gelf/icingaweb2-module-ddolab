DDO Lab
=======

Icinga Data Backend laboratory. Not meant to do anything useful right now. This
can be broken without any pre-announcement at any time.

Requirements
------------

Initially we want to waste as less time on writing code as possible. Therefore
we borrow such from eventually unrelated modules. Currently, to get this up and
running what you need is:

* Icinga Director (&gt; 1.3.0)
* Businessprocess (&gt; 2.0.0)
* Icinga Web 2 (&gt; 2.4.1)
* PHP (&gt; 5.6.0)

Director needs to be fully configured.

Getting started
---------------

We need lot's of checks, please read how to get meaningful [random check results](
doc/13-Random-Check-Results.md).
